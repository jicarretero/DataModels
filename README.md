# DataModels
This is some starting point to start defining one API to develop the Project. The Data Models must be compliant with [NGSIv2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7653483/github-relative-link-in-markdown-file). There are also definitions to be used without NGSI.

To validate the example file provided against the Data Models defined, the ajv tool could be used. Or if online better verification can be used using the tool: [https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/)

However, the file "validate.txt" contains information on how to validate the example.

In the NGSI forder there is a modified version of the DataModel to be used with NGSIv2. The example can be used to create an entity in the Orion Context Broker. So, it can be queried, deleted or whatever.
